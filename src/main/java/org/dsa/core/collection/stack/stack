-> Stack is a child class of Vector and implements List interface
-> Stack stores a group of objects b using a mechanism called LIFO
-> LIFO stands for Last in first out , it means last inserted element deleted first.
-> Legacy class


=======================
Stack Class Constructor:
========================
Stack<E> s = new Stack<E>( );


Methods:
-> We can use all collection Methods
-> We can also use legacy methods of Vector class like addElement(), removeElement(),setElementAt(),.....
-> But if we want to follow the LIFO mechanism, we should use Stack methods like follows
1. E push(E obj) : this method will add new element into the Stack
2. E pop() : this method deletes the top element available on Stack
3. E peek() : this method just returns the top element available on Stack
