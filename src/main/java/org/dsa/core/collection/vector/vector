Vector is the implementation class of List interface which is also used to store group of individual objects where duplicate values are allowed
-> Vector is exactly similar to ArrayList but ArrayList is not a synchronized class where Vector is a synchronized class
-> Vector is also called legacy class because it is available from java 1.0 version.
